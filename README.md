## Adds a Gun üî´

The Gun derives from the Boxing Glove, and it is used the same way.\
On being attacked with the Gun, the victim will be sent back to spawn.\
The victim can disable this in the Config, or by not having the mod installed,\
in which case it will act as if they had been punched instead.

The Gun model and texture is stolen from Shadow the Hedgehog (2005).\
Thanks to BillyBnMOfficial for uploading the Gun to The Models Resource.

This is my first mod for this game!
